                <ul>
                    <li>Lines: help denote regions to show areas that candidates won electoral votes</li>
                    <li>Areas: the visualization is a map that is divided into areas based on the locations of the states</li>

                <h1> Channels </h1>
            <div class= "content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Color: This channel represents the categorical variable that is political party. 
                        It is used to distinguish between the states that the Republican and 
                        Democratic parties won in the electoral college. This is a good choice for 
                        this category because it shows a clear visual distinction between the parties.</li>

                    <li>Shapes: This channel represents the cateogorical variable that is states. 
                        Different states are different shapes and this is shown by this channel. This is a good 
                        choice because it allows for the creation of a map that is easily recognizable and 
                        shows the regions based on state, which is critical to this information. Moreover, squares
                        are used at the bottom to offer more information about states where both parties are
                        represented equally. This is also a good idea because it visually helps differentiate 
                        how each party impacted that state. Moreover, shapes are used to create a bar where the 
                        overall votes obtained by both candidates is shown. This is a good choice because it offers 
                        insight into the overall results of the race.</li>

                    <li>Area: This channel represents the quantitative variable that is area through 
                        a sequencial order. This again helps create the visualization of the map. Diffeent 
                        states are different sizes and this reflects different areas. For states like California 
                        or Texas, this is a very important piece of information to decide their impact on the 
                        race. Therefore, this is a very good choice! Moreover, areas are used to show which candidate
                         got more votes overall, offering a easy way to quantify the proportion of total votes each 
                         candidate got at the end. This makes it a very good channel to represent that information!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Categorical: This colormap represents the categorical variable that is party. 
                        This is a good choice since there are two distinct parties. Therefore, all 
                        that is required are two colors to represent them both. </li>
